I can make your dream to the life.
Plz DM me.


I am a carer for my father and looking to change careers and get into games for the first time. I have been attending a bunch of industry events such as WASD, EGX & Downham Games Career Festival to network and find out how to start my journey into games.

I've also been going to open days at uni's to see if a degree in games is for me. I have met some amazing people along the way and I am beginning to get the hang of LinkedIn but I see Discord is where everyone hangs out and helps each other. I hope I can find advice and help and start to give some in the future and hold the door open for others.
