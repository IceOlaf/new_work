Dear, sir.
I was able to send you a proposal so quickly because I have worked like that project before and have experience with it.
As you can see my proposal is put last, so I sent the proposal quickly so you can see my proposal.
As for the project, I want to discuss it specifically with charting.
Of course project is important to me, but if I can talk to you at least one sentence, I am satisfied with that and can complete the project for free.
I really enjoyed seeing your project.
I think it is a great honor for you to see my proposal.
Also, I think your project is very suitable for me.
I will do my best until you are satisfied with any project.
I am waiting for you.
Thanks. Really
