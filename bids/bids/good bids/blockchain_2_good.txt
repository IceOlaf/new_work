Hello, Client
Congrats on job posting.

Before my explanation, I want to give thanks to you.
Because you gave me an opportunity where I can use all my talent in development.
 
***Don’t waste your time on other freelancers or auto bidders.***:)

I am a professional Blockchain developer. my main skill is Golang,Rust, solidity & web3.js & React.js.
Until now, I have developed many smart contract with Golang.
I am also familiar with Ethreum and EVM.
I have worked from Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, Pivx, Monero, Litecoin, Numus, and so on and worked with Tokens : ERC20, ERC721, TRC20, TRC721 and BEP20(fuel token), BEP721(artwork token to mint).
So I am sure that I can help you and if you hire me, I will start work right now and do my best to finish your task in a short deadline.
Hope to discuss more details of this project.
Even if you don't end up hiring me for now and we can potentially work together on other jobs in the future.
So please do ask me any questions about the development process.
Let’s achieve our dream.
Believe me.
