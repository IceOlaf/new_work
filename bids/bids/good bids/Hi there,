Hi there,
★★★ Crypto / Blockchain / C / C++ Expert ★★★ 7+ Years of Experience ★★★
I've read requirements and ready to build website with similar functions to coinmarketcap with some adjustments..

I have forked from Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, Pivx, Monero, Litecoin, Numus, and so on and worked with Tokens : ERC20, ERC721, TRC20, TRC721 and BEP20(fuel token), BEP721(artwork token to mint).

I can customize open source project according to your want and needs based on pancakeswap, binance, coinbasemarket, steem blockchain.

Websites we built:
✔ https://virtuse.exchange/pro/trading
✔ https://bitxmi.com/
✔ https://onbtc.io/
✔ http://proxynode.network/
✔ https://github.com/BancCoin/banccoin-core
✔ https://yearncash.finance/
