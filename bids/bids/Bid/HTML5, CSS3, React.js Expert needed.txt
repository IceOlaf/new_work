Dear Aliaksandr.

I just read your job posting and it sounds like you need a talented full stack developer.
I’d be curious to hear if you’ve tried to explain about your job.
I recently implemented that with another client and the result was "crio.do".
If it seems like a good fit, we’ll schedule a call to talk.

Thank you.
Lucas Chi
