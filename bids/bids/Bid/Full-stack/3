// start-up team


Hi there,

I just wanted to reach out and let you know how incredibly interested I am in the job posting for a skilled react developer that you have available. 

The most appealing aspect resides in my fervor that extends beyond mere financial gains. I am genuinely enthused about the chance to advance and cultivate my professional journey while acquiring further expertise amidst a vibrant collective of individuals or organizations.

In the future, it's possible that your team may require additional developers who specialize in AI or the blockchain field. Well, you're in luck because I have expertise not only in full-stack development, but also in AI and blockchain.

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working as a Sr. Staff Software Engineer, which is a highly sought-after position in the US, for a period of 3 years. Additionally, I have been working as a freelancer for the past year, which has allowed me to expand my skillset even further.

Right now, I am actively seeking out a company or team where I can contribute my expertise as a web developer and continue to grow professionally. So, please don't hesitate to reach out to me when the time is right for you.

Looking forward to potentially working together!
