// Team

Greetings,

I have comprehended your requirement for a proficient React developer capable of collaborating with the QA team.

My expertise primarily lies in teamwork rather than mere knowledge. 
Rest assured, React is among my primary competencies and I also possess the capability to lead a team. 

Prior to the unfortunate outbreak of COVID-19, I assumed the role of team lead for a group comprising seven developers in my previous organization, which spanned for a duration of one year.

During my tenure at the aforementioned company, my team and I successfully completed the development of an e-commerce website and management system for a Texas-based company. Additionally, we undertook the creation of various websites for our organization.

To be candid, React is a small piece of my skills.

Should you be in search of an honest and responsible developer, I am eager to contribute as a member of your team. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience if you find my profile intriguing.

Thank you.
