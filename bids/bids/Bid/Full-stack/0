Hi, Thank for for posting this job.
I mastered React, Javascript, API Integration, Data Scraping, etc which you require, and other languages and frameworks.

From 5 years of experience, I found out Team Collaboration, Client Satisfaction, Timely Project Delivery, and Attention to Detail are more important than knowledge.

If you agree, I'd like you to hire me.
