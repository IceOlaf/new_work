I just read your job posting and it sounds like you need a full stack(MERN,MEVN) developer.
I saw your upwork history and I think you are an excellent client.
So I am sure if I work with you, your application will be an excellent one.
I’d be curious to hear if you’ve tried explain your design.
I recently implemented that with another client and the result was http://crio.do.
I am a dedicated and talended Next.js/React.js developer with more than 5+ years of experience. 


My Skills:
- Languages: JavaScript, Node.js,TypeScript, ES6, C/C++, PHP, Python, Rust, golang

If it seems like a good fit, we’ll schedule a call to talk.
I would be happy to assist you, as I am practically online 24/7.
I sincerly hope that you will take a minute to check about my bid.
I will be never disappointed.
Looking forward your reply.
