I am a talented javascript developer.

Your task sounds like it has innovative ideas and detailed contents.
If you don't choose a proper developer, you may make a fault.
I have a deep knowledge and experence of React.js, Vuejs, nextJs and so on, and there are some examples here.

Dear Aliaksandr.

I just read your job posting and it sounds like you need a talented full stack developer.
I’d be curious to hear if you’ve tried to explain about your job.
I recently implemented that with another client and the result was "crio.do".
If it seems like a good fit, we’ll schedule a call to talk.

Thank you.
