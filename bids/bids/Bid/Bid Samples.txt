Thank you.
Rimsky Chen.
Please share me your recent MERN experience
I can show my project deployed via firebase.:https://maui-staging-c2a12.web.app/.

Yes, I have.

The most interesting thing about React is everything is the components, mean we can reuse and also, this component can be rendered base on state. I dont like the life cycle of React, quite complicated to make full control.
About the ref, I used it one times. I did the validation form and use ref. This case is using third party DOM element's attributes
