Dear Raymond.

I’m applying to your job post because I’m currently looking for a new project.

As a web designer, I worked for agencies that needed website designs. In that way, I’ve got experience in designing products and promotional websites.

In fortune, I recently implemented Vue.js project with another client and the result was http://defi.instadapp.io.
I can send you more work samples if it is necessary.

Let me know if you need more details about my work.

Kind regards.
Martin C.
