Hello,
I am experienced in web scraping and would be delighted to assist you with your App project. My expertise lies in extracting data from multiple websites and integrating it into a SQL or s3, MongoDB database.

The web scraper I develop will be capable of extracting data based on the user's geolocation, along with a specified radius or maximum number of entries. Rest assured, the scraper will only collect publicly available information and will not handle any user data.

The ultimate goal is to create a dynamic database that aggregates data based on the user's location, allowing for comparison and analysis (with a focus on price comparison).

I understand that this is an ongoing data collection process whenever the user interacts with the app. I am fully capable of implementing this functionality and ensuring a seamless experience for your users.

If you provide further details regarding your specific requirements, I can tailor the solution accordingly.

I am based in Texas and have extensive experience in backend app development. I believe my skills and expertise are well-aligned with your project needs.

Please feel free to share additional information, and I would be happy to discuss how we can proceed further. There are potentially more projects that I can contribute to as well.

Thank you for considering my services,
