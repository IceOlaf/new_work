Dear Ben.

I just read your job posting and it sounds like you need a well- experienced full stack developer who can work with you passionately.
I recently implemented that with another client and the result was "http:\\crio.do".
I am interested in your job and I am sure I will make your project properly.

My Skills:
- Languages: JavaScript, Node.js,TypeScript, ES6, C/C++, PHP, Python, Rust, golang
- Frameworks: React, Next, Vue, Nuxt, Angular, Django, Express
- Blockchain: ERC20/721/1155, Several APIs, Solidity, Vyper
- Version Management: git

Do you have a similar website so I can understand this more?
If it seems like a good fit, we’ll schedule a call to talk.

Thank you.
Lucas Chi.
