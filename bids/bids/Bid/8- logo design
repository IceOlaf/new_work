hi, there
With a passion for blending minimalistic design with a retro flair, I am confident that I can deliver a logo that encapsulates the essence of your brand and appeals to your target audience.

My professional expertise in logo design includes:

A strong understanding of branding and the ability to translate a company's identity into visual design.
Experience in creating logos that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional across various mediums and applications.
Proficiency in design software such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, ensuring high-quality vector outputs suitable for both digital and print.
A keen eye for typography and the skill to craft custom lettering that conveys the retro vibe while maintaining a clean, modern look.
For Quintessence Rides, I envision a logo that harnesses the elegance and timelessness of classic cars, using a sophisticated and restrained color palette of black or grey as requested. The focus will be on crafting bespoke typographic elements that reflect the 'quintessential' nature of your offerings, ensuring the logo is versatile and scalable from website headers to business cards.

Here's how I will approach your project:

Initial Consultation: Discuss your vision, preferences, and any specific elements you wish to include in the logo.
Concept Development: Create several design concepts for your review, each aligning with the minimalistic yet retro theme.
Revisions: Refine your chosen concept through rounds of feedback and adjustments to ensure the final design meets your complete satisfaction.
Final Delivery: Provide you with a comprehensive logo package, including various file formats (AI, EPS, PNG, JPEG) and a style guide for consistent brand application.
I am ready to start this exciting project and can deliver the initial logo concepts within 50 hours.

My rate for the complete logo design service is 1000$, which includes all the stages mentioned above.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with a detailed discussion about your brand and design preferences, or if there are any additional requirements you have in mind. I am committed to creating a logo that truly represents Quintessence Rides and resonates with the classic car community.
